## Part 3: tracing the script

For each line with a command, what its standard output and standard error are for this run, and whether its return code was zero or nonzero

For each line with an if statement, whether the condition was true or false, and why

Indicate each line that does not run (maybe because it is in an if branch that doesnâ€™t evaluate, or after an early exit)
